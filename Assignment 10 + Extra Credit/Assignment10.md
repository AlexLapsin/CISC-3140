**Team Project:**

YouTube

- Used to look video tutorials on python, flask, MySQL etc.

- Pros: Various tutorials on almost any topic

  instructors had different approach on solving a specific issue.

GitHub/Git

- Definitely a useful tool used by us to collaborate code on the
  project

- Pros: Useful to keep track of the progress

- Cons: Some people weren\'t used to this platform and had trouble
  pushing the code while using Git

WhatsApp

- Created a group to communicate mainly between backend team members

- Pros: Very common, easy to navigate and communicate

- Cons: None

Slack

- Used mainly to communicate between teams

- Pros: Was easy to communicate with different teams and coordinate
 our project

Library Presentation Rooms

- Used to get ready for the presentation and to meet with team members

- Pros: Was easy to reflect and practice our group presentation

- Cons: May have to stay in a line to get it



**Individual Project:**


PyCharm

- Used to write the Python code used for presentation

- Pros: Very easy to write and organize the code

- Cons: Lacking knowledge of the IDE's full potential

MySQL workbench

Pandoc

  different software package

Repl.it

- Pros: Very fast and easy online IDE

- Cons: You need to be connected to the internet for your code to run
  at all

Google/GeeksforGeeks/Stack Overflow

- Last but not least. Probably the most important tools used to search
  for errors when stuck and get advice on how to solve the issues

- Pros: Helped with everything - from tutorials searches to debugging
  and problem solving

- Cons: May be hard to solve an issue if you don't know what you are
  looking for
